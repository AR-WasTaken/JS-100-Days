# JS-100-Days

Today I worked on creating something simple, I created a counter app. 

Simply press one of the buttons, the green one increases the number while the red one decreases the number, the white one resets the number. 
The color changes to green when the number is positive, and it changes to red if the number goes into the negatives, the color is white while the number is 0.
